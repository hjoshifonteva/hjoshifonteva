# Hi, I’m Himanshu 👋

**Technical Lead · Salesforce Architect · Developer Tooling Enthusiast**

I believe the best architectures start simple and scale by design, not by accident.

I build and lead **enterprise Salesforce platforms** with a strong focus on **clean architecture, integrations, and developer productivity**. My work spans **Apex & LWC**, large-scale **CRM systems**, **payment workflows**, and **internal tooling / IDE concepts** that help teams move faster without sacrificing quality.
